# Function

The function of this code (as if it wasn't obvious in the name of the folder) is to convert audio in M4A to MP3, it is easily adaptable to other formats and encodings.

# History

My mother bought a new sound box but her songs in m4a format were not accepted, we had the option of converting directly using some software or website, but there were more than 1500 songs to convert and it becomes completely unplayable, so there I went to try venturing into python without any real experience.

# Use mode

Place your audios in `.m4a` format in the same folder as the main.py, the conversion will be performed keeping only the `.mp3` format file, so leave the original files in backup.
